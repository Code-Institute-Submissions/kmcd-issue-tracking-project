# KMcD Issue Tracker

![alt text](/static/images/headfordsunset.jpg "Headford Sunset")

## **1.1 PURPOSE**

_KMcD Accounting Solutions_, provides an Online Accounting System for small to medium-sized businesses. While the accounting system has been well-received, clients are experiencing issues with it and many have requested additional features. A means of logging these issues and features is required that will allow us to focus on fixing the issues that are of highest priority to our clients, and delivering new features in a timely manner. This will help us to respond quickly to their needs and improve client satisfaction. Hence the decision was made to create an online [issue tracker app](https://kmcd-issue-tracker.herokuapp.com/issue_tracker/apphome/).



# **2. UX**

## **2.1 BACKGROUND**

An Issue Tracking System is required where clients can log the issues that they are experiencing with the _KMcD Online Accounting System_, as well as request new features that they would like added to the software. 

The Issue Tracking System will allow clients to see each otherâ€™s issues, and feature requests, comment on them, and upvote them.

While bug fixes will be free, inputting, commenting on, and upvoting new features will cost a certain amount of money depending on the complexity of the requested feature (this will be decided on by the Vendor).

The issue tracker will be used by both the vendor (_KMcD Accounting Solutions_) and clients to monitor the progress of issues / features.

## **2.2 WEBSITE REQUIREMENTS**

### **2.2.1 High Level Requirements**

These are the high level requirements for [the issue tracker app](https://kmcd-issue-tracker.herokuapp.com/issue_tracker/apphome/).

1. The [the issue tracker app](https://kmcd-issue-tracker.herokuapp.com/issue_tracker/apphome/) is required to be a central point where clients can log all    issues that they are experiencing with the _KMcD Online Accounting System_, and where they can log new features that they require
2. So that clients don't have to input the same issue/feature that another client has, the app should allow clients to search for issues/features and to 
   flag another clients' issue, to indicate they have this also, and to pay a price to flag a feature (their own or another client's) that they require
3. Clients must be able to add comments on their own and on other clients' issues and features
4. Clients should be able to see all the comments input against a particular issue/feature
5. Clients must be able to run an issues and a features report that shows a list of the issues/features they have input and the issues that they have         flagged
6. The app requires two perspectives, a client perspective and a vendor perspective
7. Since the business contract is between the client and the vendor, not between one client and another, there are certain things a client should not be      able to do in relation to another clients' details - in the interests of data protection :
   - While clients should be able to see other clients' issues and features, but they should _not_ be able to see another client's client code or name, nor   the user id of a user who is associated with another client (this includes user ids shown on issues, features, and on comments)
   - Clients should not be able to edit / update another client's issues / features
   - A client should **not** have access to another client's reports
   - Clients **should** be able to see the user id of comments input by a user that is associated with the vendor
8. A client should not be able to see another client's issues or features until that client is satisfied with the details input and has set the               issue/feature to an appropriate status to allow other clients to view it
9. Once the issue / feature is at a status where other clients can view it, the client should not be able to edit its details - they should only be able to    update the client assigned user of the issue / feature
10. Since there is a contract between the vendor and the client there is no restriction required as to what client details the vendor can see:
    - The vendor shoud be able to see the client code and name
    - The vendor they should be able to see the user ids of isssues, features, and of comments
    - The vendor should be able to see reports for all clients
11. A vendor-side user should not be able to input new issues / features
12. A vendor-side user should not be able to edit the details of an issue/feature
13. A vendor-side user should be able to update the vendor assigned user, the status, and the priority on issues
14. A vendor-side user should be able to update the vendor assigned user, the status, and the price on features
15. It should be possible to filter issues by various options, status, priority, and for vendor-side users, by client
16. It should be possible to filter features by various options, status, sort them by amount paid, and for vendor-side users, filter by client
17. It should be possible for both vendor and clients to input comments on issues and features
18. It should be possible for both vendor and clients to view comments input on issues and features
19. It should be possible to differentiate comments input by vendor-side user from comments input by client-side users

## **5.2 JASMINE Testing**

**NOTE**
1. I am not sure if I have taken the right approach to Jasmine testing, but here's what I have done:
   - I have taken the functions that deal with user interactions and created some jasmine tests
   - I have removed any code that takes values from the DOM or adds information to the DOM
   - The values being tested are passed in from calcSpec
   - I have based the test around being able to return the correct Marker Labels and Location names only 
   - I am testing only my own javascript code - I'm not testing dc/d3 or maps (I don't know how to do that)


    
### 5.2.1 Navigation Test

1. I tested that the Main Headings (Lodgings, Safari, and Sight Seeing) returned the correct marker labels and location names
2. I tested that the Filter Piecharts returned the correct marker labels and location names depending on which 'slice' was selected

## **CODE SNIPPETS**

1. I have used code from the mini project to add a map to Rosie's resume, to load my map.
2. I used https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/place-details to add an infowindow for the location 
   name to the markers.
3. I have copied classes from my Milestone 1 project for the navigation bar, the links and hovering.
4. Comments have been added in the files where copied code is used.
5. With assistance from Slack I copied code from Stack Overflow to close the burger menu
